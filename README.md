# AmbiLite TV - An EECS 373 Final Project
#### By Daniel Calco, Jorge Garcia & John Gitterman

Created for the University of Michigan's EECS 373 (Introduction to Embedded Systems) final project. You can view a working demo, read some background information, and view our poster at [our carrd.co website](https://373ambilite.carrd.co/)! 

In this repo you'll find STM32CubeIDE code for the STMs that control the IR Remote & the LEDs, respectively. The python files control our interface to the camera & capture card, respectively. 

Debug mode can be activated on the python code to view some of the internal workings of what is being displayed, the interpolation of it, and what is being outputted.
